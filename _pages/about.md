Hello, I'm Jie. Nice to meet you!

You may also call me Jay. My legal name is Janice, though I'm planning to change that soon. 

Also, this is my first time making a personal website, so please bear with me!

Bio
-----
I was born in Texas, but mostly raised in New Jersey. I completed my undergraduate studies in Cell Biology and Neuroscience at Rutgers University. Afterwards, I worked in a proteomics group at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, where I developed a strong interest in computational biology. So I returned to school, completing a Biomedical Informatics Masters program at Columbia University before joining my current PhD program at Mount Sinai. With the guidance of Dr. Eric Sobie and his cardiac systems pharmacology lab, I completed my thesis project on optimizing a computational pipeline to generate virtual twins for iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in December 2024. In my free time, I enjoy trying new foods and restaurants, working out (except leg day), and relaxing with my friends and my cat.
